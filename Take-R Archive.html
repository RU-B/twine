It seems you are in denial.

&#39;&#39;In Denial we ignore the existence of something.&#39;&#39;

You are not aware of the issue. Some say this is ignoring the problem, but it’s really not even knowing there is an issue to contend with.

&#39;&#39;In Justify we use excuses for things being the way they are&#39;&#39;

You look for something to blame (i.e., blame circumstances) “It’s just the way things are” = “It’s not my fault”.

A natural reaction, but not resourceful. Circumstances must change for things to get better I can’t do anything about it.

&#39;&#39;In Shame we lay blame on ourselves (often felt as guilt)&#39;&#39;

You blame your self “It’s my fault – I’m rubbish” It’s just the way I am.

&#39;&#39;In Obligation we do what we have to instead of what we want to&#39;&#39;

You do it under duress (against your will, you feel forced) “I have to do it” = “I have no choice”.

You feel being held accountable by others, (force) feelings of I must, have to or else.

Not self steered

Natural, but not resourceful I’m trapped by circumstances – things won’t get better I’ll do the quickest fix possible. Fixes the symptoms, not the cause.

Two sons work for their father on the family&#39;s farm. The younger brother had for some years been given more responsibility and reward, and one day the older brother asks his father to explain why?

The father says, &quot;First, go to the Kelly&#39;s Farm and see if they have any Geese for sale - we need to add to our stock.&quot; The older son soon returns with the answer, &quot;Yes they have five Geese, which they are ready to sell to us.&quot;
The father then says, &quot;Good, please ask them the price.&quot;
The older son returns with the answer, &quot;Each Geese cost us $10.&quot;
The father says, &quot;Good, now ask if they can deliver the Geese tomorrow.&quot;
And duly the older son returns with the answer, &quot;Yes, they can deliver the Geese by tomorrow.&quot;

The father asks the older son to wait and listen, and then calls his younger son from a nearby field, &quot;Go to the Davidson&#39;s Farm and see if they have any Geese for sale - we need to add to our stock.&quot;

The younger son soon returns with the answer, &quot;Yes, they have five Geese for $10 each, or ten Geese for $8 each; and they can deliver them tomorrow - I asked them to deliver the five unless they heard otherwise from us in the next hour. And I agreed that if we want the extra five geese we could buy them at $6 each.&quot;

The father turned to the older son, who nodded his head in appreciation. He now realized why his younger brother was given more responsibility and reward.

It shows that your are a normal human being, as a matter of fact blaming somebody is also perfectly normal human behaviour.

When something is not going as expected we are hard wired to get out of this situation as it is not comfortable and the first option is to lay balme to somebody. When we discover there is nobody to blame we move to blaming circumstances.

How did this happen to us?

This is a very common reaction. When you discover that something is going wrong your mind starts a cause-effect-search. We start coping with the mismatch between what we want and the problem we have.

So if we do not know how to &#39;&#39;deal&#39;&#39; with a situation right away our mind starts &#39;&#39;coping&#39;&#39; with the sitation.

The story is created for you to experiance The Responsibility process. Showing you what happens in your mind when you have to deal with a problem. By a problem we mean any mismatch between what we expected to happen and reality.

Personal and shared responsibility, widely demonstrated throughout the enterprise, provides the essential context and lubricant for agility. 

Things hum.

When something goes wrong stuff starts happening in our brain, we start coping with the situation. In the below model you can see al the coping stages we can experiance:

&lt;img src=&quot;resources\Responsibility-Process.png&quot; alt=&quot;Responsibility-Process&quot; style=&quot;width:241px;height:300px;&quot;&gt;

Learning about this model can help people improve their respons-ability.

(link:&quot;More on the model&quot;)[The model shows mental stages or coping stages:

&#39;&#39;Denial&#39;&#39; 
we ignore the existence of something

&#39;&#39;Lay Blame&#39;&#39; 
we hold others at fault for causing something

&#39;&#39;Justify&#39;&#39; 
we use excuses (circumstances) for things being the way they are

&#39;&#39;Shame&#39;&#39; 
we lay blame on ourselves (often felt as guilt

&#39;&#39;Obligation&#39;&#39; 
we do what we have to instead of what we want to

&#39;&#39;Quit&#39;&#39; 
we give up to avoid the pain of Shame and Obligation

&#39;&#39;Responsibility&#39;&#39; 
we own our ability and power to create, choose, and attract

These mental positions are natural. We all experience them every day.

The first six mental states (Denial, Lay Blame, Justify, Shame, Obligation, and Quit) are how we cope with problems that we don’t yet know how to face and solve. Think of them as coping mechanisms or defense strategies. In these mental states, our problem doesn’t go away, instead we learn to cope with it.

The mental state—Responsibility—is the mental state in which we grow to overcome problems.]

A natural reaction, but not resourceful. The problem hasn’t gone away – I’m still hurt. I can’t do anything about it.
